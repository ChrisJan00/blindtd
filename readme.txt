Blind TD was planned to be a black box tower defense game.

I never got around to implement more than a basic maze generator and A* pathfinding. 
There isn't any game implemented, sorry about that.

Originally developed for LOVE 0.5 <http://love2d.org>.

Update 5-Jan-2015:  Fixed for running the pathfinding example on LÃ¶ve2D 0.9.x
